## Usage

The `jscroll` method is called on the selector for which you want your scrollable content contained within. For example:

```javascript
$('.jscroll').jscroll();
```

The `jscroll` method takes an optional object literal as a parameter for overriding the default options. An example of how this can be done is shown below.

```javascript
$('.jscroll').jscroll({
    loadingHtml: '<img src="loading.gif" alt="Loading" /> Loading...',
    padding: 20,
    nextSelector: 'a.jscroll-next:last',
    contentSelector: 'li'
});
```

## Options

* `debug (false)` - When set to true, outputs useful information to the console display if the `console` object exists.
* `autoTrigger (true)` - When set to true, triggers the loading of the next set of content automatically when the user scrolls to the bottom of the containing element. When set to false, the required next link will trigger the loading of the next set of content when clicked.
* `autoTriggerUntil (false)` - Set to an integer great than 0 to turn off `autoTrigger` of paging after the specified number of pages. Requires `autoTrigger` to be `true`.
* `loadingHtml ('<small>Loading...</small>')` - The HTML to show at the bottom of the content while loading the next set. Can be disabled by setting `loadingHtml` to `null` or `false`.
* `padding (0)` - The distance from the bottom of the scrollable content at which to trigger the loading of the next set of content. This only applies when autoTrigger is set to true.
* `nextSelector ('a:last')` - The selector to use for finding the link which contains the href pointing to the next set of content. If this selector is not found, or if it does not contain a href attribute, jScroll will self-destroy and unbind from the element upon which it was called.
* `contentSelector ('')` - A convenience selector for loading only part of the content in the response for the next set of content. This selector will be ignored if left blank and will apply the entire response to the DOM.
* `pagingSelector (null)` - Optionally define a selector for your paging controls so that they will be hidden, instead of just hiding the next page link. If you want to completely disable the hiding functionality set it to `false` or empty string (`''`).
* `callbackAfter (null)` - Optionally define a callback function to be called after a set of content has been loaded.
* `callbackBefore (null)` - Optionally define a callback function to be called before loading a set of new content.

For more information on the `contentSelector` option and how it loads a response fragment, see the [jQuery documentation for the .load() method](http://api.jquery.com/load/).
